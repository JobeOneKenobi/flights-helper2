NEXT UP: STAGE 2
work on running flight searches, storing in google sheets, and doing more in depth analysis and comparison of the best flights
add integration of users preferences such as morning or evening, and ability to compare flights with logic based
off price and time / duration / layovers

STAGE 3:
summarize results and send to user

STAGE 4: handling an iterative approach, where user can make adjustments to their preferences, specific requests, etc.

STAGE 5: make it conversational and intuitive where keywords are not as strictly required

Next thing to work on:
Logic
    need logic / checklist for the code to run, whether im using it via my computer, and typing text
    in the console, or via j.o.e texts where it asks questions / confirms understanding until every
    box is checked, and then it runs a search

    it will start by pulling from preferences file then ask questions until complete

    stage 1- display results

    stage 2 - new set of logic to determine whether the results are satisfactory / run followup searches

    stage 3 - need logic to determine when to start a new search (this should be simple)
